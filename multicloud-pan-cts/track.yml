title: Palo Alto Firewall Network Infrastructure Automation with Consul-Terraform-Sync
  Workshop
teaser: Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewalls and Consul-Terraform-Sync Workshop
description: In this workshop you'll learn how to automate the provisioning and management
  of traditional network infrastructure using Terraform, Vault Consul, and Consul
  Terraform Sync. Eliminate exposure to operational overhead and security risk while
  accelerating the deployment and scaling of applications and services.

  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will start by installing Terraform

    In the `Shell` tab, execute the following command to install Terraform:

    ```
    apt-get install terraform
    ```

    The "Terraform Code" tab contains all of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates used by Terraform to build the Infrastructure. Feel free to look over the code!

    In the `Shell` tab, deploy the Azure Infrastructure by running the following commands:

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    The following will be deployed:

    * Azure VNets/Subnets/Routing
    * Palo Alto Firewall in it's own VNET
    * Vault - Secrets Management
    * Consul - Service Registry and Discovery (Source of truth)
    * Bastion Server
    * Logging Server

    This is part of our Day 0 deployment in an Infrastructure as Code World.

    NOTE: Palo Alto takes about 6+ mins to deploy in azure

    To get specific outputs, In the `Shell` tab, execute the following commands:

    Consul IP

    ```
    terraform output consul_lb
    ```

    Vault Management IP

    ```
    terraform output vault_lb
    ```

    Vault Management IP

    ```
    terraform output vault_lb
    ```

    Palo Alto Management IP

    ```
    terraform output https_paloalto_mgmt_ip
    ```

    Continue to configuring the PAN Firewall
