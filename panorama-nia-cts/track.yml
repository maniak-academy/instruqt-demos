  Workshop
teaser: Panorama Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewalls and Consul-Terraform-Sync
  Workshop
description: In this workshop you'll learn how to automate the provisioning and management
  of traditional network infrastructure using Terraform, Vault Consul, and Consul
  Terraform Sync. Eliminate exposure to operational overhead and security risk while
  accelerating the deployment and scaling of applications and services.

    Let's explore the terraform code.

    Click on the Terraform Code, and take a look how we build
    - Dyanmic Address Groups
    - Network Address Translations (NATs)

      The next challange we will start by building out the Shared Infrastructure <br>

      Build <br>
       - Hashicorp Vault <br>
       - Hashicorp consul <br>
       - Logging Server <br>
       - Bastion Server <br>
  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will start by installing Terraform

    In the Shell tab, execute the following command to install Terraform:

    ```
    apt-get install terraform
    ````

    The "Terraform Code" tab contains all of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates used by Terraform to build the Infrastructure. Feel free to look over the code!

    Go to the 'Terraform Code' File explore and edit the 'terraform.tfvars' and put the username that was emailed to you.

    ```
    owner = "replaceme"
    ```

    Make sure to save the configuration (click on the save button)

    In the 'Shell' tab, deploy the Azure Infrastructure by running the following commands:

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    The following will be deployed:

      Azure VNets/Subnets/Routing
      Vault - Secrets Management
      Consul - Service Registry and Discovery (Source of truth)
      Bastion Server
      Logging Server

    With Consul being our Service Regisry and source of truth, we need to make sure that VAULT has successfuly beeing deployed.

    To get specific outputs, In the Shell tab, execute the following commands:

    CONSUL URL
    ```
    terraform output consullb
    ```

    VAULT URL [the token = root ]
    ```
    terraform output vaultlb
    ```

      The next challange we will start by building out our Security Zone/HUB that will deploy our PAN OS firewalls.  <br>


      Process: When we hit the terraform apply
       1. Network/VNETS/Load Balancers/IPs will be deployed
       2. PANOS will be bootstrapped from the Panorama

      Note: The entire process takes about 10-12 min

  assignment: |-
    Let's deploy the PAN OS in our infrastructure


    In the 'Shell' tab, execute the following command to install Terraform:

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    NOTE: To deploy the PANS it takes about 10 mintues.

    While, your waiting.. log into the Panorama https://20.118.98.21/

    When you log into the panorama click on 'PANORAMA > Managed Devices > Summary' your device will start to register and go through the process.

    When you see the status as "Connected" with a "commit sucessed" you can move onto deploying the apps.

    Let's deploy some apps

    NOTE: Make sure the panos have been booted and are "connected" within panorama

    In the 'Shell' tab, execute the following command to install Terraform:
